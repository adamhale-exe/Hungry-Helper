## About

This is my first project I intend on using multiple times a week! I am planning on building an app that stores all of the recipes that my fiancee and I make on a regular basis and helps decide what we should cook tonight! Perfect for those evenings when you just cant choose!

## Getting Started

- All current module dependencies are stored in the package.json file
- Initially you will need to host the server yourself and connect to your own SQL database.
- I have included a reset database script to create and seed the SQL tables with some recipes so you get an idea of the format of the data

### Prerequisites

- For a full list of modules required please refer to the package.json file

### Installation

- Open the git clone in your preferred IDE and launch the terminal
- Run the following command to install the required dependencies

    ``` npm i ```

- Once the modules are installed you can run the following command to launch the server

    ``` npm run dev ```

- Congratulations, you can now decide what to eat tonight!
